Data Visualization using d3.js of college admission data

Have visualized California college's admission's data from the year 2004 to 2015.
Each college is a circle, circle's radius is the acceptance rate of the college, color is the SAT score(more blue means more score) and the arc on the edge means the ACT score(longer the arc means more score).

Got the data from data.gov, sanitized it using python script which is included in the data folder.

Steps to run ->
1. Open terminal in the cloned repo
2. Run -> npm install
3. Run -> npm start

Output ->
